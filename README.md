# **TeamUP FOOTBALL** ‚öΩ

**TeamUP FOOTBALL** is an Android application designed to simplify the organization of amateur football (soccer) matches. This app helps users create, join, and manage football games with ease, addressing common challenges such as managing participants, ensuring privacy, and tracking player performance.

## üöÄ **Work in Progress**

I am actively developing **TeamUP FOOTBALL**, with the goal of publishing it on the Google Play Store. The app aims to bring a seamless and user-friendly experience to football enthusiasts by combining key features such as:

- **Profile Management**: Each user has a personal profile with stats, a reputation score, and feedback, making it easier for organizers to assess the reliability and skills of participants.
- **Match Creation & Participation**: Users can create matches, invite players, and join games with just a few taps.
- **Feedback System**: After each match, feedback is collected to update players' profiles and help others choose reliable teammates.
- **Notifications and Location Services**: Reminders for upcoming matches and field location features make it easier to stay organized and on time.

My focus is on delivering an application that strikes a balance between simplicity and functionality, without cluttering the user interface.
